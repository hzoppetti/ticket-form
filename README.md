# Touring Bands!

## Access

This project can be found in [Heather's GitHub ticket-form repository](https://github.com/hzoppetti/ticket-form) repository.

## Running

To run this project, download from the repository above by cloning the project into a local directory. For example,

```
git clone https://github.com/hzoppetti/ticket-form.git
```

This is a Vite project that uses React, Typescript, and Tailwind. You'll want to grab the dependencies by running npm.

```
npm i
```

Then you can start your local dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

This makes the project available in your local browser at an address such as `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

However, I also have an example of this [project running on Netlify](https://meek-mermaid-c73df7.netlify.app)

## Notable Notes

I admit to taking a bit longer on this assignment than the suggested 2 hours. I took approximately 2 hours for the core and then hated how it looked and went back and implemented Tailwind. We had been playing around with Tailwind at my last job and I wanted to explore it a little more, so I took some time to do that here.

I sadly didn't spend a lot of time on form validation or accessibility. There is a lot that could be done in both of those places but I ran out of time.

I sprinkled some more notes about in comments and I'm sure we will go over those during review.
